        <h2>My Bio ðŸ‘‘</h2>
        <p>
          Miho works as an overseas sales representative for a
          semiconductor-related company. When she was considering using websites
          and the Internet as part of sales promotion activities, she got
          curious how the things work, and decided to learn coding on her own.
          As she learned, she was hooked into the world of software development.
          Balancing full-time job as a sales rep and learning programming was
          never easy, but genuine curiosity for technology and an aspiration for
          improvement keeps her going.
          <br />
          She learned front-end technologies, including Reactjs, at a SheCodes
          workshop. She is about to start learning backend technologies as well
          and aim to become a full-stack developer eventually in the near
          future.
