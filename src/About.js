        <h2>My Bio ðŸ‘‘</h2>
        <p>
          Miho works as an overseas sales representative for a
          semiconductor-related company. When she was considering using websites
          and the Internet as part of sales promotion activities, she got
          curious about how things work, and decided to learn coding on her own.
          As she learned, she was hooked into the world of software development.
          Balancing full-time job as a sales rep and learning programming was
          never easy, but a genuine curiosity for technology and an aspiration
          for improvement keep her going.
          <br />
          She learned front-end technologies, including Reactjs, at SheCodes
          workshops. She is about to start learning backend technologies as well
          and aims to become a full-stack developer eventually in the near soon.
