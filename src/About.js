        <h2>My Bio</h2>
        <h3>My CareerðŸ‘‘</h3>
        <p>
          I work in the field of electronics, as a sales representative mainly
          for overseas customers. I became interested in using websites as part
          of promotional activities during the Covid-19 period, and taught
          myself front-end skills while maintaining a full-time job. I am
          interested in using technology to improve people's lives in general,
          and am also learning Python aiming to automate some of my office work.
          In her sales career, I have communicated with people in different
          positions/fields, negotiating with customers, coordinating internally,
          and dealing with transporters. In addition to my sociable nature, I
          have also acquired the ability to pay attention to details through my
          work.
        </p>
        <h3>My PhilosophyðŸŒº</h3>
        <p>
          I believe that life is a series of transformations. Until the age of
          20, I could only speak Japanese, but I took a leap of faith and
          learned English. I am always eager to learn new things. Since I have a
          growth mindset myself, I want to push those who follow me to do their
          best. I can't wait for my new chance to work as a front-end engineer!
        </p>

        <h3>My InterestðŸŽ¸</h3>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy reading, practicing guitar, karaoke, and
          doing decorative sushi-making. Traveling is also one of my passion.
          Seeing historical architecture and relaxing in cafes to enjoy the
          local atmosphere is my favorite way.
        </p>
